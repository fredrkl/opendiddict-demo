# OpenIdDict for ASP.NET Core Example

I have previously used IdentityServer4, now called Duende, for implementing
OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 in ASP.NET Core applications. Since I only need
the bare minimum of features, and minmal amount of traffic I wanted to try out
OpenIdDict as a lightweight alternative.
